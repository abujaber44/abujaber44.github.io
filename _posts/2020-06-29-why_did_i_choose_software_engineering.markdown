Programing has been always an interesting topic (profession) to me. I majored in Computer Science in 2008 but I changed my major in sophomore year to Pure and Applied Mathematics. I graduated in 2012 and worked for several companies utilizing my skills in different professions. I enjoyed using Excel and write a VBA to make my bookkeeping job easier. Ultimately, I decided to become a Software Engineer to enjoy the power of coding. My decision was based on multiple aspects of this job like: troubleshooting and creativity. 

In April 2020, I decided to go back to school and finish what I started twelve years ago. Passing Flatiron’s Software Engineering Boot camp is a first step in a long journey that I hope it will be full of success and fun ….


Good luck to all of us … ***June 15 2020 SE Students ***
